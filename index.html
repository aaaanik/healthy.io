    <h2>Nutrition</h2>
    <p>Nutrition is a practical toolkit for feeling better now and protecting long-term health. Focus on varied, minimally processed foods, balanced meals, hydration, and habits that fit your lifeâ€”small sustainable changes matter more than short-term perfection. If you have specific goals (sports performance, weight change, medical conditions), tailored guidance from a registered dietitian or qualified clinician is recommended.</p><br>

    <h2>Exercise</h2>
    <p>Regular physical activity is crucial for maintaining overall health and well-being. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise per week, along with muscle-strengthening activities on two or more days a week. Find activities you enjoy to make exercise a sustainable part of your lifestyle.</p><br>

    <h2>Sleep</h2>
    <p>Quality sleep is essential for physical and mental health. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night, and establish a consistent sleep schedule by going to bed and waking up at the same time each day. Create a relaxing bedtime routine, limit exposure to screens before bed, and ensure your sleep environment is comfortable and free from distractions.</p><br>
